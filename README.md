# OpenClaw Agents — Multi-Agent Telegram Supergroup Templates

> **Production-tested templates for building AI agent teams on [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.sh) with Telegram supergroup integration.**

This is an **OpenClaw-specific** project. These templates are designed to run on the OpenClaw platform — they use OpenClaw's agent system, workspace structure, session management, `sessions_send` for bot-to-bot communication, and Telegram channel bindings. If you're not running OpenClaw, these won't work out of the box.

Built from a real production setup running 10 autonomous agents coordinated through a Telegram supergroup with dedicated topic channels. Each agent has its own bot, personality, workspace, and domain expertise.

## Credits & Inspiration

Agent personality patterns and the concept of specialized AI agent divisions are inspired by **[The Agency](https://github.com/msitarzewski/agency-agents)** by [@msitarzewski](https://github.com/msitarzewski) — a collection of 55+ specialized AI agent personalities built for Claude Code. Great resource for agent design philosophy, personality crafting, and workflow patterns regardless of what platform you run.

What we build here is different: the **operational infrastructure** for running those kinds of agents as a live, coordinated team on OpenClaw — with Telegram supergroups, shared context files, bot-to-bot triggers, cron schedules, topic-based team channels, and structured escalation chains.

## What Is This?

A complete template kit for deploying a multi-agent team on **OpenClaw + Telegram**:

- **SOUL.md templates** — Agent personality and behavior definitions
- **IDENTITY.md templates** — Agent metadata and capabilities
- **Workspace templates** — Shared context, memory, and coordination files
- **openclaw.json snippets** — Configuration for agents, bindings, channels, and teams
- **AI Instructions** — Step-by-step setup guide written for AI agents to follow
- **Architecture docs** — How agents communicate, escalate, and share context

### Key Concepts

- **One bot per agent** — Each agent has its own Telegram bot token
- **One topic per team** — Teams share a topic channel in a supergroup
- **Primary + Secondary agents** — Primary owns the topic; secondary responds when mentioned or triggered
- **Shared context via files** — Agents coordinate through shared markdown files, not APIs
- **Structured escalation** — Clear rules for when to escalate up the chain

## Quick Start

### For Humans

See [`docs/supergroup-setup.md`](docs/supergroup-setup.md) for the full step-by-step guide.

### For AI Agents

See [`INSTRUCTIONS.md`](INSTRUCTIONS.md) — a complete setup guide written specifically for AI agents to follow. Give it to your orchestrator agent and let it handle the setup.

## Team Configurations

### Build Team (Code > QA > Deploy)

**Topic:** Single shared topic
**Agents:** Coder (primary) + QA (secondary) + DevOps (secondary)
**Flow:** Coder builds > triggers QA via `sessions_send` > QA tests > triggers DevOps > DevOps deploys

### Research Team

**Topic:** Single shared topic
**Agents:** Researcher (primary) + Growth Analyst (secondary)
**Flow:** Researcher posts findings > triggers Analyst for metrics/experiments

### Social Team

**Topic:** Single shared topic
**Agents:** Content Creator (primary) + Community Manager (secondary)
**Flow:** Content posted on Twitter <> adapted for Reddit, cross-pollination of insights

---

## Agent Communication

### Bot-to-Bot via sessions_send

Telegram bots **cannot** see each other's messages. This is a Telegram limitation. Use OpenClaw's `sessions_send` to trigger teammates:

```
sessions_send(agentId="qa-agent", message="QA request:\n- What: [description]\n- Where: [URL/path]\nPost your verdict in the topic.")
```

The receiving agent gets the message as a new session input and can then post their response in the shared topic using the `message` tool.

### Shared Context via Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `THESIS.md` | Business direction — all agents read |
| `SIGNALS.md` | Intelligence hub — research writes, everyone reads |
| `FEEDBACK-LOG.md` | Style corrections — any agent writes, all read |
